# zim-plugin-instantsearch
Search as you type in Zim, in similar manner to OneNote Ctrl+E.

When you hit Ctrl+E, small window opens, you can type. As you type third letter, every page that matches your search is listed. You can walk through by UP/DOWN arrow, hit Enter to stay on the page, or Esc to cancel.
Much quicker than current Zim search.

ToDo:  see Issues.

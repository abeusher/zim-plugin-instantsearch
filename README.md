# zim-plugin-typesearch
Search as you type in Zim, in similar manner to OneNote Ctrl+E.


ToDo:  
	* integrate â€“ gui window instead of Search in the top right corner  
	  * it shouldnt be small window in the middle of nowhere. When the search takes longer than 10 seconds, Zim main window seems temporarily freezed (and it lags to display pages).  
	* search internally, not by the external "zim --search" CL command
	* add description  
	* highlight fulltext search results (just as the normal fulltext search does)

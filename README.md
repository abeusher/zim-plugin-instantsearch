# zim-plugin-instantsearch
Search as you type in Zim, in similar manner to OneNote Ctrl+E.

When you hit Ctrl+E, small window opens, you can type. As you type third letter, every page that matches your search is listed. You can walk through by UP/DOWN arrow, hit Enter to stay on the page, or Esc to cancel.
Much quicker than current Zim search.

Known to work on Ubuntu 15.10, Zim 0.65.
I'd be glad to hear from you if it's working either here in the issues or in the original bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/zim/+bug/1409626 .
